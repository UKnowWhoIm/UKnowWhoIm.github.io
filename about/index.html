That interest grew when I was introduced to HTML in 8th grade, we were taught how to create a form but not how to handle it, so I looked for answers on my own and found PHP. I deployed my first website when I was 14. It was a website with useful resources for students. The code was a disaster though, some horrible snippets I wrote then still haunt me in my sleep.</p><p>Then I learned heared about python and learned it on my own when I finished 10th grade. I developed small hobby projects with python but due to collge prep I couldn&rsquo;t do much.</p><p>When I reached college, I restarted the developer in me with the help of some awesome mentors. I took full advantage of quarantine, learned so much and did some internships and volunteer work.</p><h3 id=what-do-i-bring-to-the-table>What do I bring to the table

I&amp;rsquo;m just a curious kid who loves solving real world problems using code.
My brief history in programming (Cringe Warning, Skip Ahead) I developed an interest towards programming when we where taught QBasic in 6th grade. That interest grew when I was introduced to HTML in 8th grade, we were taught how to create a form but not how to handle it, so I looked for answers on my own and found PHP.</description></item><item><title>Aion Creative Wings</title><link>/work-experience/aion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/work-experience/aion/</guid><description>Front End Developer</description></item><item><title>Chess Bot</title><link>/projects/chess-bot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/chess-bot/</guid><description>Go to TLDR
I had done Multiplayer Chess as my school project, redid the same on django after learning it. Then I looked into chess programming. At first I was just curious, but I soon learned about MiniMax, Alpha Beta pruning, etc.
To test the waters, I made an AI for a simple game like Othello. After I successfully created a challenging AI for Othello, I proceeded to start doing it for Chess.</description></item><item><title>Django Test Action</title><link>/projects/django-tests-action/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/django-tests-action/</guid><description>This is a github action built using Docker to run your django tests to ensure that you don&amp;rsquo;t break existing stuff while making new changes

At the time I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what a github action was, so I learned about github actions by doing this small project.
Doing this project allowed me to learn about Github Actions and Workflows, which are indispensable tools to have as a maintainer.</description></item><item><title>Multiplayer Chess</title><link>/projects/chess/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/chess/</guid><description>This is an online multiplayer chess game implemented using express.js, websockets, MongoDB and JS at its core.

This was made using a mix of vanilla django and DRF.

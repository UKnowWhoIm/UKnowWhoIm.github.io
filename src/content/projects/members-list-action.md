A college senior suggested an idea, to automatically create a list of members of a github organization.

At the time I didn't know what a github action was, so I learned about github actions by doing this small project.

Doing this project allowed me to learn about Github Actions and Workflows, which are indispensable tools to have as a maintainer.

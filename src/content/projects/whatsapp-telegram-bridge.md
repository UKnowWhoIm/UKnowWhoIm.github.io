Go to [TLDR](#tldr)

As the deadline for accepting WhatsApp's new release was approaching, our class group was engaged in a heated discussion about moving to telegram. Many wanted to, but couldn't as the official group containing teachers, would have to be in whatsapp, as the teachers had no interest in moving.

Seeing the argument getting nowhere, I saw a suggestion that if we could somehow bridge the apps, we could achieve the best of both worlds. 

I browsed github casually, so I knew there were some good unofficial WhatsApp APIs, and telegram had an official API. So it wasn't much work bringing them together and linking a whatsapp chat to a telegram chat.

##### TLDR

I made a node script to link an unofficial Whatsapp API with Telegram API, to recieve whatsapp chats on telegram.

### About

This was an intership for a startup of a college senior. We were a team of 10 interns working on different projects.

### What did I learn and experience?

- Flutter from scratch. 
- How to deploy a lightweight app without backend on FireStore.
- This was my first collaborative project, so I understood all the benefits of a team behind you.

### What did we build?

A collection of apps for a restaurant management system.

Hi there, 

I'm just a curious kid who loves solving real world problems using code. 

### My brief history in programming (Cringe Warning, Skip Ahead)

I developed an interest towards programming when we where taught QBasic in 6th grade. That interest grew when I was introduced to HTML in 8th grade, we were taught how to create a form but not how to handle it, so I looked for answers on my own and found PHP. I deployed my first website when I was 14. It was a website with useful resources for students. The code was a disaster though, some horrible snippets I wrote then still haunt me in my sleep. 

Then I learned heared about python and learned it on my own when I finished 10th grade. I developed small hobby projects with python but due to collge prep I couldn't do much.

When I reached college, I restarted the developer in me with the help of some awesome mentors. I took full advantage of quarantine, learned so much and did some internships and volunteer work.

### What do I bring to the table

I'm natuarally curious, a quick learner, and I am passonate about solving problems.

Still working on this....
